Another\\nlarge share - 8.5% in total and 30% of Practical Guidance - is general how-to advice on a variety\\nof topics. Technical Help includes Computer Programming (4.2% of messages), Mathematical Calcu-\\nlations (3%), and Data Analysis (0.4%).

In contrast, Zao-Sanders (2025) estimates that Therapy/Companionship is\\nthe most prevalent use case for generative AI.9\\nWe also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First,\\nwe show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time,\\nand may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active\\nusers had typically masculine first names.10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025,\\nwith active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that\\nnearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps\\nhave narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively\\nfaster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and\\nusers in highly-paid professional occupations are substantially more likely to use ChatGPT for work.\\nWe introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is\\nseeking, using a simple rubric that we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing.11\\nAsking is when the\\nuser is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving\\nmodels of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and\\nSchneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)). Doing is when the user wants to produce some output\\nor perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al.\\n(2003)). Expressing is when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or\\naction. We estimate that about 49% of messages are Asking, 40% are Doing, and 11% are Expressing.\\nHowever, as of July 2025 about 56% of work-related messages are classified as Doing (e.g., performing\\njob tasks), and nearly three-quarters of those are Writing tasks. The relative frequency of writing-\\nrelated conversations is notable for two reasons. First, writing is a task that is common to nearly all\\nwhite-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top “soft” skills demanded by\\nemployers (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024). Second, one distinctive feature of\\ngenerative AI, relative to other information technologies, is its ability to produce long-form outputs\\nsuch as writing and software code.\\nWe also map message content to work activities using the Occupational Information Network\\n(O*NET), a survey of job characteristics supported by the U.S. Department of Labor. We find that\\nabout 81% of work-related messages are associated with two broad work activities: 1) obtaining,\\ndocumenting, and interpreting information; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems,\\nand thinking creatively. Additionally, we find that the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage\\nare highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activities Getting\\nInformation and Making Decisions and Solving Problems are in the top five of message frequency in\\nnearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales\\noccupations.\\nOverall, we find that information-seeking and decision support are the most common ChatGPT\\nuse cases in most jobs.

       " 'response': 'According to the provided context from the document \"How People Use ChatGPT,\" the average person primarily uses AI for a variety of practical and creative tasks. The most common uses include seeking information and advice, which fall under categories like Education, Practical Guidance, and General How-To guidance. Many users leverage AI to produce written content, software code, spreadsheets, and digital products, highlighting its capability to generate long-form outputs. \\n\\nSpecifically, a significant portion of conversations involves asking for tutoring or teaching, with 10.2% of all messages and 36% of Practical Guidance messages related to these functions. Users also frequently seek general advice on topics such as health, hobbies, or daily tasks, often requesting help in technical areas like programming, mathematical calculations, and data analysis. Additionally, there is a notable use of AI for self-expression, including personal reflection and role-playing, though these comprise smaller percentages of interactions.\\n\\nThe document emphasizes that many users benefit from AI’s ability to deliver customized responses and generate content tailored to individual needs. Overall, the typical use involves information-seeking, decision support, content creation, and task execution across various domains.\\n\\n**Source:** \"How People Use ChatGPT\" (Page 17 and Page 43).'}"

      "According to the information from the document \"How People Use ChatGPT,\" technical professionals are utilizing AI, particularly generative AI like ChatGPT, to enhance their work in several ways. They primarily use AI for decision support, which is especially valuable in knowledge-intensive tasks. AI helps improve productivity by assisting in tasks such as generating writing, software code, spreadsheets, and other digital products. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most user interactions with ChatGPT involve requests to modify inputs rather than creating entirely new content. Education is a major application, with users seeking tutoring, teaching, and practical guidance across various topics. Technical help users often request coding assistance, mathematical calculations, and data analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, generative AI provides customized responses that are tailored to specific needs, making it more flexible than traditional web search engines. It allows for novel modifications of user-provided content and supports follow-up requests, which can lead to more efficient decision-making and problem-solving. Overall, AI tools like ChatGPT serve as co-workers or co-pilots, augmenting human capabilities and increasing productivity in a range of professional tasks.\n",
      "The concept of Matryoshka Representation Learning has been explored in several recent papers. According to a paper published on arXiv in June 2024 titled \"Matryoshka Representation Learning for Recommendation\" by Riwei Lai et al., it introduces a novel approach to representation learning where user and item vectors are restructured into Matryoshka representations. These representations consist of incrementally dimensional and overlapping vector spaces that explicitly capture hierarchical preferences and features. The method involves constructing training triplets at different levels and a specialized negative sampling mechanism to ensure effective learning of the hierarchical structure. The approach has demonstrated substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods across various datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there are related works that discuss the use of hierarchical or layered autoencoders (like Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders) to interpret neural network concepts at various abstraction levels, which aligns with the idea of nested or layered representations.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're interested in detailed methodologies or specific applications, I can help analyze those papers further.\n"

In this paper, we introduce a novel matryoshka representation\\nlearning method for recommendation (MRL4Rec), by which we restructure user and\\nitem vectors into matryoshka representations with incrementally dimensional and\\noverlapping vector spaces to explicitly represent user preferences and item\\nfeatures at different hierarchical levels. We theoretically establish that\\nconstructing training triplets specific to each level is pivotal in\\nguaranteeing accurate matryoshka representation learning. Subsequently, we\\npropose the matryoshka negative sampling mechanism to construct training\\ntriplets, which further ensures the effectiveness of the matryoshka\\nrepresentation learning in capturing hierarchical user preferences and item\\nfeatures. The experiments demonstrate that MRL4Rec can consistently and\\nsubstantially outperform a number of state-of-the-art competitors on several\\nreal-life datasets.

Matryoshka combines a novel syntactic parser-employing precise regular\\nexpressions rather than wildcards-with a completely new semantic parsing layer\\nthat clusters variables and maps them into a queryable, contextually meaningful\\nschema. This approach provides analysts with queryable and semantically rich\\ndata representations, facilitating rapid and precise log querying without the\\ntraditional burden of manual parser construction.

    "### Report on the Rise of Context Engineering in the LLM Space in 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "As we move further into 2025, the landscape of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, particularly in the domain of large language models (LLMs). One significant trend emerging is \"context engineering,\" which has begun to outpace the earlier focus on prompt engineering. This report explores how context engineering is reshaping the dynamics of AI usage, enhancing the capabilities of LLMs to perform complex tasks, and ultimately influencing the way users interact with AI technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Emergence of Context Engineering\n",
    "In previous years, prompt engineering involved crafting inputs to guide LLMs to generate desired outputs. However, by 2025, the limitations of traditional prompt engineering have become evident, especially as applications require more dynamic interactions and multi-turn dialogues. Context engineering has emerged as a new paradigm, prioritizing the construction of strategies and systems that enable LLMs to access and utilize extensive contextual information effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern LLMs, such as GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3, now boast context windows that can handle up to 1 million tokens. This substantial increase allows these models to grasp more extensive content, such as books or lengthy documents, fundamentally changing what they can achieve in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Developments in Context Engineering\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Knowledge Management**: The shift towards context engineering facilitates more sophisticated knowledge management within AI systems. These systems now use persistent memory and adaptive reasoning, enabling them to maintain context across interactions. For example, agent-based LLMs can now engage in workflows requiring multiple exchanges, which is vital for complex applications requiring follow-ups and extended dialogues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Context Lengths**: Advances in transformer architectures have led to the possibility of extending native context lengths dramatically. As a result, LLMs can process larger datasets directly, enhancing their capacity to deliver accurate and relevant outputs without extensive re-prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Compression and Retrieval**: Techniques such as context compression, where information is stored externally or synthesized to maximize relevance, are gaining traction. Methods identified in recent studies highlight the importance of integrating efficient retrieval systems and summarization techniques to make the most of the available context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Rise of Multi-Agent Systems**: In 2025, LLM applications are increasingly shifting towards multi-agent architectures, where different AI agents work collaboratively, leveraging various tools and pieces of information to improve output accuracy and reduce operational inefficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Impact on AI Usage\n",
    "The implications of context engineering are far-reaching and transformative for users and organizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Enterprises adopting context engineering report accuracy rates of 90-95%, a significant improvement over the 65-75% typically associated with earlier methods. This rise in performance is generating more trust in AI systems across various sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster Deployment and Cost Efficiency**: Organizations employing structured context engineering have demonstrated a 3x increase in the speed of bringing AI solutions to production and a 40% reduction in operational costs compared to traditional prompt-based methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaptability and Scalability**: Context-engineered systems are inherently more adaptable, allowing businesses to scale AI applications rapidly in response to evolving needs without overhauling the underlying architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Augmentation of Human Intelligence**: As context engineering allows AI systems to interact in more meaningful ways, they are increasingly positioned as partners in decision-making processes, rather than mere tools. This evolution enhances the collaborative potential between humans and AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The rise of context engineering marks a critical turning point in the development and application of LLMs. As AI systems become increasingly capable of managing and utilizing complex contextual information, they are set to enhance user experiences, improve efficiency, and drive new innovations across industries. Organizations that embrace this trend will likely lead the charge into a future where AI is not just a tool for automation but a collaborative partner in problem-solving and creativity."
