Education is a major use case for ChatGPT. 10.2% of all user\\nmessages and 36% of Practical Guidance messages are requests for Tutoring or Teaching. Another\\nlarge share - 8.5% in total and 30% of Practical Guidance - is general how-to advice on a variety\\nof topics. Technical Help includes Computer Programming (4.2% of messages), Mathematical Calcu-\\nlations (3%), and Data Analysis (0.4%).

In contrast, Zao-Sanders (2025) estimates that Therapy/Companionship is\\nthe most prevalent use case for generative AI.9\\nWe also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First,\\nwe show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time,\\nand may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active\\nusers had typically masculine first names.10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025,\\nwith active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that\\nnearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps\\nhave narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively\\nfaster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and\\nusers in highly-paid professional occupations are substantially more likely to use ChatGPT for work.\\nWe introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is\\nseeking, using a simple rubric that we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing.11\\nAsking is when the\\nuser is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving\\nmodels of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and\\nSchneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)). Doing is when the user wants to produce some output\\nor perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al.\\n(2003)). Expressing is when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or\\naction. We estimate that about 49% of messages are Asking, 40% are Doing, and 11% are Expressing.\\nHowever, as of July 2025 about 56% of work-related messages are classified as Doing (e.g., performing\\njob tasks), and nearly three-quarters of those are Writing tasks. The relative frequency of writing-\\nrelated conversations is notable for two reasons. First, writing is a task that is common to nearly all\\nwhite-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top “soft” skills demanded by\\nemployers (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024). Second, one distinctive feature of\\ngenerative AI, relative to other information technologies, is its ability to produce long-form outputs\\nsuch as writing and software code.\\nWe also map message content to work activities using the Occupational Information Network\\n(O*NET), a survey of job characteristics supported by the U.S. Department of Labor. We find that\\nabout 81% of work-related messages are associated with two broad work activities: 1) obtaining,\\ndocumenting, and interpreting information; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems,\\nand thinking creatively. Additionally, we find that the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage\\nare highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activities Getting\\nInformation and Making Decisions and Solving Problems are in the top five of message frequency in\\nnearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales\\noccupations.\\nOverall, we find that information-seeking and decision support are the most common ChatGPT\\nuse cases in most jobs. This is consistent with the fact that almost half of all ChatGPT usage is'),\n",

       " 'response': 'The average person primarily uses AI for a variety of purposes, with a significant focus on writing conversations that typically involve requests to modify existing inputs rather than creating entirely new content. Education is a major use case, with about 10.2% of all user messages and 36% of Practical Guidance messages related to tutoring or teaching. Additionally, many users seek general how-to advice on diverse topics, accounting for 8.5% of total messages and 30% of Practical Guidance. Technical help such as computer programming, mathematical calculations, and data analysis also constitute a smaller portion of usage.\\n\\nBeyond informational needs, AI is used for self-expression, including relationships, personal reflection, games, and role play, though these constitute a smaller share of interactions. Users leverage AI’s ability to generate customized content—like workout plans, product ideas, or fantasy football suggestions—highlighting its versatility over traditional web search engines. The data indicates that information-seeking and decision support are among the most common use cases across different occupations and demographics. \\n\\nOverall, many users rely on AI for tasks involving writing, software code, spreadsheets, and other digital products, especially as AI can produce long-form outputs and assist with tasks across a wide range of activities (Local). \\n\\nSource: HowPeopleUseAI'}"

This paper presents two novel trajectory-prediction methods\\nbased on real-time position measurements and adaptive input and state\\nestimation (AISE). The first method, called AISE/va, uses position measurements\\nto estimate the target velocity and acceleration. The second method, called\\nAISE/FS, models the target trajectory as a 3D curve using the Frenet-Serret\\nformulas, which require estimates of velocity, acceleration, and jerk. To\\nestimate velocity, acceleration, and jerk in real time, AISE computes first,\\nsecond, and third derivatives of the position measurements. AISE does not rely\\non assumptions about the target maneuver, measurement noise, or disturbances.\\nFor trajectory prediction, both methods use measurements of the target position\\nand estimates of its derivatives to extrapolate from the current position. The\\nperformance of AISE/va and AISE/FS is compared numerically with the\\n$\\\\alpha$-$\\\\beta$-$\\\\gamma$ filter, which shows that AISE/FS provides more\\naccurate trajectory prediction than AISE/va and traditional methods, especially\\nfor complex target maneuvers.'),\n",

However, the current focus of Vitis Libraries and limited research\\nhas mainly been on how to invoke AIE modules, without delving into a thorough\\ndiscussion on effectively utilizing AIE in its typical use cases. As a result,\\nthe widespread adoption of Versal ACAP has been restricted. The Communication\\nAvoidance (CA) algorithm is considered a typical application within the AIE\\narchitecture. Nevertheless, the effective utilization of AIE in CA applications\\nremains an area that requires further exploration. We propose a top-down\\ncustomized design framework, EA4RCA(Efficient AIE accelerator design framework\\nfor regular Communication-Avoid Algorithm), specifically tailored for CA\\nalgorithms with regular communication patterns, and equipped with AIE Graph\\nCode Generator software to accelerate the AIE design process. The primary\\nobjective of this framework is to maximize the performance of AIE while\\nincorporating high-speed data streaming services. Experiments show that for the\\nRCA algorithm Filter2D and Matrix Multiple (MM) with lower communication\\nrequirements and the RCA algorithm FFT with higher communication requirements,\\nthe accelerators implemented by the RA4RCA framework achieve the highest\\nthroughput improvements of 22.19x, 1.05x and 3.88x compared with the current\\nhighest performance acceleration scheme (SOTA), and the highest energy\\nefficiency improvements of 6.11x, 1.30x and 7.00x.'),\n",

While intrinsic\\nproficiency, especially in tasks such as grading, has been measured and studied\\nextensively, perceived proficiency remains underexplored. Here it is shown\\nthrough Monte Carlo multi-agent simulations that trust networks among students\\ninfluence their perceptions of the proficiency of an AI tool. A probabilistic\\nopinion dynamics model is constructed, in which every student's perceptions are\\ndescribed by a probability density function (PDF), which is updated at every\\ntime step through independent, personal observations and peer pressure shaped\\nby trust relationships. It is found that students infer correctly the AI tool's\\nproficiency $\\\\theta_{\\\\rm AI}$ in allies-only networks (i.e.\\\\ high trust\\nnetworks). AI-avoiders reach asymptotic learning faster than AI-users, and the\\nasymptotic learning time for AI-users decreases as their number increases.\\nHowever, asymptotic learning is disrupted even by a single partisan, who is\\nstubbornly incorrect in their belief $\\\\theta_{\\\\rm p} \\\\neq \\\\theta_{\\\\rm AI}$,\\nmaking other students' beliefs vacillate indefinitely between $\\\\theta_{\\\\rm p}$\\nand $\\\\theta_{\\\\rm AI}$. In opponents-only (low trust) networks, all students\\nreach asymptotic learning, but only a minority infer $\\\\theta_{\\\\rm AI}$\\ncorrectly. AI-users have a small advantage over AI-avoiders in reaching the\\nright conclusion. In mixed networks, students may exhibit turbulent\\nnonconvergence and intermittency, or achieve asymptotic learning, depending on\\nthe relationships between partisans and AI-users. The educational implications\\nof the results are discussed briefly in the context of designing robust usage\\npolicies for AI tools, with an emphasis on the unintended and inequitable\\nconsequences which arise sometimes from counterintuitive network effects.\")],\n",
       " 'response': 'Based on the provided context, the documents do not explicitly describe how the average person uses AI in daily life. Instead, they focus on specific technical applications and the influence of trust networks on perceptions of AI proficiency, such as trajectory prediction, accelerator design frameworks, and trust in AI assistants. \\n\\nHowever, one of the documents suggests that AI is used in educational tools, where perceptions of AI proficiency influence how students trust and interact with AI-based educational tools. This implies that the average person might use AI in educational contexts, relying on AI for grading, assistance, or learning support. Additionally, general inferences from the context suggest that AI tools are integrated into various systems to improve performance, efficiency, and decision-making.\\n\\nTherefore, the way the average person uses AI could include interacting with AI-powered educational tools, navigation and guidance systems, and other decision support applications, often relying on AI for tasks that benefit from automation, prediction, or trust-based interactions. \\n\\n(Source: Local)',\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "As we move further into 2025, the landscape of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, particularly in the domain of large language models (LLMs). One significant trend emerging is \"context engineering,\" which has begun to outpace the earlier focus on prompt engineering. This report explores how context engineering is reshaping the dynamics of AI usage, enhancing the capabilities of LLMs to perform complex tasks, and ultimately influencing the way users interact with AI technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Emergence of Context Engineering\n",
    "In previous years, prompt engineering involved crafting inputs to guide LLMs to generate desired outputs. However, by 2025, the limitations of traditional prompt engineering have become evident, especially as applications require more dynamic interactions and multi-turn dialogues. Context engineering has emerged as a new paradigm, prioritizing the construction of strategies and systems that enable LLMs to access and utilize extensive contextual information effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern LLMs, such as GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3, now boast context windows that can handle up to 1 million tokens. This substantial increase allows these models to grasp more extensive content, such as books or lengthy documents, fundamentally changing what they can achieve in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Developments in Context Engineering\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Knowledge Management**: The shift towards context engineering facilitates more sophisticated knowledge management within AI systems. These systems now use persistent memory and adaptive reasoning, enabling them to maintain context across interactions. For example, agent-based LLMs can now engage in workflows requiring multiple exchanges, which is vital for complex applications requiring follow-ups and extended dialogues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Context Lengths**: Advances in transformer architectures have led to the possibility of extending native context lengths dramatically. As a result, LLMs can process larger datasets directly, enhancing their capacity to deliver accurate and relevant outputs without extensive re-prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Compression and Retrieval**: Techniques such as context compression, where information is stored externally or synthesized to maximize relevance, are gaining traction. Methods identified in recent studies highlight the importance of integrating efficient retrieval systems and summarization techniques to make the most of the available context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Rise of Multi-Agent Systems**: In 2025, LLM applications are increasingly shifting towards multi-agent architectures, where different AI agents work collaboratively, leveraging various tools and pieces of information to improve output accuracy and reduce operational inefficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Impact on AI Usage\n",
    "The implications of context engineering are far-reaching and transformative for users and organizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Enterprises adopting context engineering report accuracy rates of 90-95%, a significant improvement over the 65-75% typically associated with earlier methods. This rise in performance is generating more trust in AI systems across various sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster Deployment and Cost Efficiency**: Organizations employing structured context engineering have demonstrated a 3x increase in the speed of bringing AI solutions to production and a 40% reduction in operational costs compared to traditional prompt-based methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaptability and Scalability**: Context-engineered systems are inherently more adaptable, allowing businesses to scale AI applications rapidly in response to evolving needs without overhauling the underlying architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Augmentation of Human Intelligence**: As context engineering allows AI systems to interact in more meaningful ways, they are increasingly positioned as partners in decision-making processes, rather than mere tools. This evolution enhances the collaborative potential between humans and AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The rise of context engineering marks a critical turning point in the development and application of LLMs. As AI systems become increasingly capable of managing and utilizing complex contextual information, they are set to enhance user experiences, improve efficiency, and drive new innovations across industries. Organizations that embrace this trend will likely lead the charge into a future where AI is not just a tool for automation but a collaborative partner in problem-solving and creativity."
