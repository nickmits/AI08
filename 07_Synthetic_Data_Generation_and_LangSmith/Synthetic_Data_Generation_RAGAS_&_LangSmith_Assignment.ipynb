People interact with AI with varying intents classified as Asking (seeking information or advice), Doing (producing output), or Expressing (self-expression). Users use AI as co-workers that produce output or as co-pilots that provide advice and improve human problem-solving productivity. Additionally, AI is flexibly used across diverse tasks such as data analysis, relationships, personal reflection, role play, and more.

This ain’t your average task automation; it’s like having a genius co-pilot in knowledge-heavy gigs, where smarter decisions mean bigger bucks.\\n\\nAccording to the mindblowing estimates from Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025), U.S. users value AI so much they'd *literally* need to be paid around $98 just to chill without it for a month. That’s roughly a jaw-dropping $97 billion in annual surplus—meaning AI is a powerhouse boosting productivity and unlocking serious economic mojo. In essence, folks leverage AI for practical guidance, info-seeking, and crafting killer content, all translating to higher output and smarter work hustle, making that money rain with AI as their secret weapon.\\n\\nSo, the rad truth? People are making bank by rolling with AI as their strategic advisor, enhancing their brainpower, and leveling up job performance rather than just offloading tasks.

        "\n",
        "When comparing the two experiments (`fresh-health-72` vs `respectful-story`), we observe clear differences in the evaluation metrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Helpfulness and Correctness**  \n",
        "   - The `respectful-story` model consistently scores higher in both helpfulness and correctness.  \n",
        "   - This is because its responses are more formal, factual, and closely aligned with the reference outputs (e.g., starting with \"Based on the provided context…\").  \n",
        "   - In contrast, the `fresh-health-72` model often uses casual or slang-like phrasing (“Yo, buckle up…”, “let’s crank this up…”), which makes the answers feel less precise and therefore less correct/helpful.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Completeness**  \n",
        "   - Both models usually mark completions as \"COMPLETED,\" but the quality of the completion differs.  \n",
        "   - `respectful-story` tends to cover the necessary information more directly, while `fresh-health-72` sometimes adds stylistic filler that doesn’t add real value.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Depthness**  \n",
        "   - In some cases, `fresh-health-72` is flagged as “deep,” but this is often due to extra descriptive or exaggerated language rather than meaningful depth.  \n",
        "   - `respectful-story` stays concise and factual, which may not be marked as “deep” but results in higher correctness.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Token Usage and Cost**  \n",
        "   - Responses from `respectful-story` are longer (3,400–3,800 tokens) compared to `fresh-health-72` (around 2,000–2,600 tokens).  \n",
        "   - This increase in token count directly raises the cost of completions, though both remain inexpensive in absolute terms.  \n",
        "   - The higher length reflects its tendency to restate context fully, which contributes to better alignment with the reference outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "Overall, the `respectful-story` model produces more helpful and correct answers because it avoids casual phrasing and sticks closer to the references. The tradeoff is longer responses and slightly higher cost. The `fresh-health-72` model is more conversational and stylized, but this reduces its correctness and perceived helpfulness in the evaluation."
