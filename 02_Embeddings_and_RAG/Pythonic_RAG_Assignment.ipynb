        "Each request to generate an embedding is executed one after another. Your code waits for the current request to finish before moving to the next one.When collecting embeddings, synchronous (sync) execution processes requests one by one, causing delays, while asynchronous (async) execution handles multiple requests concurrently, significantly improving speed and throughput, especially for I/O-bound tasks like fetching data or communicating with embedding models. Async is the optimal choice for embedding large datasets because it utilizes idle time and keeps tasks moving without blocking, whereas sync processing would lead to long wait times."

            "Response: The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\" refers to a situation where a CEO or startup founder, who previously specialized in a particular function (such as product management, sales, or marketing), hires someone weak to lead that same function after they move on. This often happens because the CEO has a hard time letting go of the function that brought them success and wants to remain \"the man\" in that area. The problem is named after Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who had been a brilliant TV network executive but, after buying ABC at Disney, saw ABC fall to fourth place. Eisner's response was that if he had two extra days a week, he could have turned ABC around himself, but he did not have that time. This exemplifies how CEOs sometimes intentionally hire weak executives to maintain control over their former specialty, to the detriment of the company. (Source 1)\n",
