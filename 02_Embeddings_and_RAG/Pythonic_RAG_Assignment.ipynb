        "Each request to generate an embedding is executed one after another. Your code waits for the current request to finish before moving to the next one.When collecting embeddings, synchronous (sync) execution processes requests one by one, causing delays, while asynchronous (async) execution handles multiple requests concurrently, significantly improving speed and throughput, especially for I/O-bound tasks like fetching data or communicating with embedding models. Async is the optimal choice for embedding large datasets because it utilizes idle time and keeps tasks moving without blocking, whereas sync processing would lead to long wait times."

            "   ```python\n",
            "   while condition:\n",
            "       # do something\n",
            "   ```\n",

            "    print(i)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",

This happens because the CEO has difficulty letting go of that function and wants to remain \"the man\" or the key figure in that area. As a result, they end up hiring someone weak on purpose in that executive role. The problem is named after Michael Eisner, the CEO of Disney who had been a brilliant TV network executive; when he acquired ABC, the network fell to fourth place, and his response was that if he had more time, he could turn it around himself. However, he did not have the extra time, illustrating the issue of a CEO trying to retain control over their former specialty instead of empowering a strong executive (\"Source 1\").\n",
