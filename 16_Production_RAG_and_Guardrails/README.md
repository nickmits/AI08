# Build 🏗️

Run the notebook and complete the following:

1. 🤝 BREAKOUT ROOM #1:
  - Task 1: Dependencies and Set-Up
  - Task 2: Setting up Production RAG and LangGraph Agent Integration
  - Task 3: LangGraph Agent Integration
2. 🤝 BREAKOUT ROOM #2:
  - Task 4: Guardrails Integration for Production Safety

## Guard Rails Set-up

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

### 2. Configure Guardrails API

**⚠️ Note:** The `guardrails configure` CLI command has a bug in version 0.5.14. Use the workaround script instead:

```bash
uv run python configure_guardrails.py
```

Or provide the API key directly:
```bash
uv run python configure_guardrails.py YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

Or set it via environment variable:
```bash
export GUARDRAILS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
uv run python configure_guardrails.py
```

Get your Guardrails AI API key from [here](https://hub.guardrailsai.com/keys).

### 3. Install Required Guards

```bash
uv run guardrails hub install hub://tryolabs/restricttotopic
uv run guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/detect_jailbreak
uv run guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/competitor_check
uv run guardrails hub install hub://arize-ai/llm_rag_evaluator
uv run guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/profanity_free
uv run guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/guardrails_pii
```

## 🚧 Advanced Build:

<details>
<summary>🚧 Advanced Build 🚧 (OPTIONAL - <i>open this section for the requirements</i>)</summary>

The caching we're using is both: 

1. Ineffecient
2. Exact Match

Please produce a locally running application (through Docker) that integrates a more intelligent caching process.

In simpler terms: 

- Use a database approach (Redis, Vectordatase, SQLite, etc.) instead of plain-memory for caching
- Implement Semantic LLM Caching OR Implement E2E Caching

> NOTE: Doing the advanced build will count as your assignment for the week. If you do the advanced build, you are not required to do the notebook.
