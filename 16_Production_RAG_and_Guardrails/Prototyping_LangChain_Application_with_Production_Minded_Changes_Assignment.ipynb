    "The process of embedding is typically very time consuming and expensive:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Send text to OpenAI API endpoint\n",
    "2. Wait for processing  \n",
    "3. Receive response\n",
    "4. Pay for API call\n",
    "\n",
    "This occurs *every single time* a document gets converted into a vector representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Caching Solution:**\n",
    "1. Check local cache for previously computed embeddings\n",
    "2. If found: Return cached vector (instant, free)\n",
    "3. If not found: Call OpenAI API, store result in cache\n",
    "4. Return vector representation\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM Response Caching:**\n",
    "Similarly, we cache LLM responses to avoid redundant API calls for identical prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- ⚡ Faster response times (cache hits are instant)\n",

    "##### ✅ Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations of Production Caching:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory vs Disk Caching Trade-offs:**\n",
    "- **Memory caching** (current approach): Fast but volatile - lost on restart, limited by RAM\n",
    "- **Disk caching** (SQLite/filesystem): Persistent but slower I/O, requires disk space management\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Balancing speed vs persistence - memory is fast but doesn't survive restarts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cache Invalidation Strategies:**\n",
    "- **Problem**: No automatic invalidation when documents are updated\n",
    "- **Stale data risk**: Cached embeddings may reference old document versions\n",
    "- **Solution needed**: Implement TTL (Time-To-Live), version tracking, or hash-based invalidation\n",
    "- **Quote**: \"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things\" - Phil Karlton\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concurrent Access Patterns:**\n",
    "- **Race conditions**: Multiple processes may cache the same data simultaneously\n",
    "- **Lock contention**: File-based caches need proper locking mechanisms\n",
    "- **Scaling issues**: Single cache instance doesn't work in distributed systems\n",
    "- **Solution**: Need distributed cache (Redis, Memcached) for multi-server deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cache Size Management:**\n",
    "- **Unbounded growth**: Current implementation has no size limits\n",
    "- **Storage costs**: Embeddings consume significant disk space over time\n",
    "- **Performance degradation**: Large caches slow down lookups\n",
    "- **Solution**: Implement LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cold Start Scenarios:**\n",
    "- **First request latency**: Empty cache means full API calls initially\n",
    "- **Warming strategies**: Pre-populate cache for common queries\n",
    "- **Regional deployments**: Each region starts cold\n",
    "- **Solution**: Cache preloading scripts or gradual warming periods\n",
    "\n",
    "**When Caching is MOST Useful:**\n",
    "1. **High-frequency repeated queries** (e.g., FAQ chatbots)\n",
    "2. **Expensive operations** (large document embeddings)\n",

      "1. Grace Period: Typically, there is a six-month grace period after you finish school before you must start making payments on your student loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Repayment Period: After the grace period, you begin making monthly payments until the loan is fully paid off. The exact length of this period depends on the loan terms and repayment plan chosen.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Forgiveness Programs: For federal loans, programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) forgive the remaining balance after 120 qualifying monthly payments (about 10 years) while working full-time for a qualifying employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Income-Driven Repayment Plans: These plans adjust monthly payments based on income and can extend repayment timelines, sometimes up to 20-25 years, depending on the plan.\n",

      "5. Refinancing and Alternative Plans: Private lenders may offer refinancing options with different repayment terms, and some offer discounts for autopay enrollment.\n",

    "## Task 4: Guardrails Integration for Production Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll integrate **Guardrails AI** into our production system to ensure our agents operate safely and within acceptable boundaries. Guardrails provide essential safety layers for production LLM applications by validating inputs, outputs, and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛡️ What are Guardrails?\n",
    "\n",
    "Guardrails are specialized validation systems that help \"catch\" when LLM interactions go outside desired parameters. They operate both **pre-generation** (input validation) and **post-generation** (output validation) to ensure safe, compliant, and on-topic responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Categories:**\n",
    "- **Topic Restriction**: Ensure conversations stay on-topic\n",
    "- **PII Protection**: Detect and redact sensitive information  \n",
    "- **Content Moderation**: Filter inappropriate language/content\n",
    "- **Factuality Checks**: Validate responses against source material\n",
    "- **Jailbreak Detection**: Prevent adversarial prompt attacks\n",
    "- **Competitor Monitoring**: Avoid mentioning competitors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Benefits of Guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "**🏢 Enterprise Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for data protection\n",
    "- **Brand Safety**: Maintain consistent, appropriate communication tone\n",
    "- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce liability from inappropriate AI responses\n",
    "- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure factual accuracy and relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚡ Technical Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Layered Defense**: Multiple validation stages for robust protection\n",
    "- **Selective Enforcement**: Different guards for different use cases\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization**: Fast validation without sacrificing accuracy\n",
    "- **Integration Ready**: Works seamlessly with LangGraph agent workflows\n"

    "\n",
    "**Your Mission**: Enhance the existing LangGraph agent by adding a **Guardrails validation node** that ensures all interactions are safe, on-topic, and compliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📋 Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Guardrails Node**: \n",
    "   - Implement input validation (jailbreak, topic, PII detection)\n",
    "   - Implement output validation (content moderation, factuality)\n",
    "   - Handle guard failures gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integrate with Agent Workflow**:\n",
    "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
    "   - Add guards as a post-processing step  \n",
    "   - Implement refinement loops for failed validations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test with Adversarial Scenarios**:\n",
    "   - Test jailbreak attempts\n",
    "   - Test off-topic queries\n",
    "   - Test inappropriate content generation\n",
    "   - Test PII leakage scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Success Criteria:**\n",
    "- Agent blocks malicious inputs while allowing legitimate queries\n",
    "- Agent produces safe, factual, on-topic responses\n",
    "- System gracefully handles edge cases and provides helpful error messages\n",
    "- Performance remains acceptable with guard overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Implementation Hints:**\n",
    "- Use LangGraph's conditional routing for guard decisions\n",
    "- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous guard validation\n",
    "- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring\n",
    "- Consider guard performance vs security trade-offs\n"

      "================================================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "🔹 Key Metrics to Track:\n",
      "    - Guardrails pass/fail rate by type\n",
      "    - Input validation failure rate\n",
      "    - Output validation failure rate\n",
      "    - Refinement trigger rate\n",
      "    - Average refinement cycles per query\n",
      "    - End-to-end latency impact\n",
      "    - False positive rate (legitimate queries blocked)\n",
      "\n",
      "🔹 Alerting Thresholds:\n",
      "    - Input validation failure > 10% (possible attack)\n",
      "    - Refinement rate > 30% (quality issues)\n",
      "    - Guardrails latency > 2s (performance degradation)\n",
      "    - False positive rate > 5% (guard tuning needed)\n",
      "\n",
      "🔹 Continuous Improvement:\n",
      "    - A/B test guard configurations\n",
      "    - Collect user feedback on blocked queries\n",
      "    - Regular review of false positives/negatives\n",
      "    - Tune guard thresholds based on production data\n",
      "    - Monitor for new adversarial patterns\n",
      "\n",
      "🔹 Cost Optimization:\n",
      "    - Cache guard validations for similar inputs\n",
      "    - Use lighter models for evaluation when possible\n",
      "    - Batch validation for multiple responses\n",
      "    - Implement early stopping for clear violations\n",

    "🔹 Key Metrics to Track:\n",
    "    - Guardrails pass/fail rate by type\n",
    "    - Input validation failure rate\n",
    "    - Output validation failure rate\n",
    "    - Refinement trigger rate\n",
    "    - Average refinement cycles per query\n",
    "    - End-to-end latency impact\n",
    "    - False positive rate (legitimate queries blocked)\n",
    "    \n",
    "🔹 Alerting Thresholds:\n",
    "    - Input validation failure > 10% (possible attack)\n",
    "    - Refinement rate > 30% (quality issues)\n",
    "    - Guardrails latency > 2s (performance degradation)\n",
    "    - False positive rate > 5% (guard tuning needed)\n",
    "    \n",
    "🔹 Continuous Improvement:\n",
    "    - A/B test guard configurations\n",
    "    - Collect user feedback on blocked queries\n",
    "    - Regular review of false positives/negatives\n",
    "    - Tune guard thresholds based on production data\n",
    "    - Monitor for new adversarial patterns\n",
    "    \n",
    "🔹 Cost Optimization:\n",
    "    - Cache guard validations for similar inputs\n",
    "    - Use lighter models for evaluation when possible\n",
    "    - Batch validation for multiple responses\n",
    "    - Implement early stopping for clear violations\n",
